# SWENG 861: Weekly Assignment Scaffold

This is the official starter repository for the **Weekly Learning Scaffold** in **SWENG 861: Software Construction**.

In this course, you will build a "Bring Your Own Domain" (BYOD) application cumulatively from Week 1 through Week 6. You will use this repository to evolve your project from a basic API into a secured, containerized, and observable system.
